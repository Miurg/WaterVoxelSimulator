# Voxel Water Simulation (Prototype)

A small experimental prototype of voxel water simulation made in Godot using GDExtension.

## Technologies

- Godot Engine  
- GDExtension (for performance)

## How to run

1. Clone the repository to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Miurg/WaterVoxelSimulator/
2. Open the project in Godot.

3. Run the project from the Godot editor (camera control uses the editor’s default camera controls).

## About
This is a test project — a simple prototype where I experimented with voxel water simulation. Made for learning and testing ideas.

## Note
The project is in an early stage and may contain bugs and unfinished features.
